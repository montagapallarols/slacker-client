# Welcome to Slacker! A community of film fans


## What this app is about

The idea for this app came about from the fact that (at least for me) keeping lists in a notes app can sometimes become an incoherent mess.
So this is a space for users to curate, review and keep a record of the films and series they've enjoyed and create lists of those they want to enjoy later.

### Pages overview: ###

- A **Home** page where users can sign up / login and see a list of other users and their recommendations. 

- A **Profile** page where you can curate your recommendations, your library and your wish list.

- An **Explore** page where users can see what's trending and publish interesting/random lists for other users. (EXTRA FEATURE)

- A **Reviews** page where users can see each other's reviews.

### Project goals ### 

After two very intense months of learning full stack web development at Codaisseur, building this app will help to solidify all the knowledge acquired: 

- Build a full stack application from scratch
- Design the app wireframes 
- Create a data model design & set up database relations
- Use an external API to fetch and organize data
- Integrate a new technology, in this case Typescript
- Write user stories
- Work with structured git version control
- Work with Github Projects (Kanban)

### User stories ###

- As a user, I want to be able to see a list of all users and favourite media on the homepage and have the ability to sign up/log in. 
- As a **new user**, I want to be able to sign up and have my own profile. If signed up already, I want to be able to log in. 
- As a **logged in** user I am able to curate my profile by adding/removing items to my lists.
- (EXTRA) As a user, I want to be able to go to the ***Explore*** page where I can see whatâ€™s trending.
- (EXTRA) As a user, I want to be able to explore lists published by other users as well as publish my own lists for other users to see. 
- As a user, I want to be able to see all the reviews that other users have left.
